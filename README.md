This is an old code-breaking game, **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)**, also known as **猜數字** or **AABB**.

## Goals
In order to learn GCP Firebase, I try to setup this project repository to record my learning progress. First stage is a pure web frontend, pure javascript based, platform. Then, I will setup the project to Firebase by modifying the sample, [FriendlyChat](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat-web), to meet our needs.

## Progress
  1. Web Frontend Stage
      - [First Draft](web1/index.html)
      - Second Trial
        - [User as guest](web2/guest.html)
        - [User as host](web2/host.html)
        - [Competition](web2/game.html)
  2. Firebase Stage
    
## License
Since the samples from Firebase Codelab are using the Apache License 2.0, I will try to use the same one. See [LICENSE](LICENSE)
